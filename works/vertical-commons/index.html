    Vertical Commons is an ambitious project that will consist many inter-related works, consisting of drawings, renders, designs, research, software, digital-commons contributions, ecology, and active participation. A unifying thread that runs through Vertical Commons is the creation of a cultural imaginary that positively intervenes in the carbon cycle. The plan so far cannot be reduced to a singular concept and is best understood as ongoing and multiplicative. For now, an overall summary of the project can be described as the following.

   <i>Vertical Commons is an experimental manifestation of an imagined activity that sees humans cultivating, building and sharing open source structures that by design, rebalance the carbon cycle at multiple points. These structures act as carbon sinks since their principle material is fast-growing and regenerative willow rods, that rapidly transform CO2 into biomass. The growing of willow also sits within UK rewilding efforts to restore wild habitats, as willow is the second most beneficial tree to other species, second to oak. The assembly of the willow rods into useable structures copies the formation of carbon nanotubes –arrangements of carbon atoms with incredible physical properties. These structures, when recreated on a human-scale, and larger, become vertical pillars upon which to elevate photovoltaics and wind power, whilst also supporting climbing plant-life, insects and birds, or to be used as communal space for growing plant-based food vertically. The towers also work as symbols – monoliths of the carbon age. The designs of these willow structures are distributed as software and 3D-print files contributed to the digital-commons, for all to copy. The project will manifest as both visual propositions and as a live experiment involving a network of participants and collaborators.    </i></p>

        “Despair is the state we fall into when our imagination fails. When we have no stories that describe the present and the guide the future, hope evaporates. Without a new story, a story that is positive and propositional rather than reactive and oppositional, nothing changes. With such a story, everything changes.” 
      <br><br> - George Monbiot, <i>Out of the Wreckage: A new politics for an age of crisis</i>, 2017.<br>

  The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged between air, earth, oceans and organic matter – the four reservoirs of carbon. The industrial age, and burning of fossil fuels in particular, has altered the balance between these reservoirs, transferring too much carbon to the air, in the gaseous form of CO2 – a process that now alarmingly threatens life on Earth by causing increasingly unsafe levels of global warming. Various societal actions can mitigate this – dropping fossil fuels, flying less, consuming less, switching to wind and solar energy, planting more trees, rewilding, and moving towards plant-based diets and agroecological approaches to growing food. These combined activities require deep shifts in worldviews and cultural attitudes that many may find hard, however, bold new stories and ideas (alongside a sense of urgency and emergency) can help shift minds to adopt and develop transformative changes in thinking and living. Vertical Commons is a reframing of existing solutions into an audacious new story, one that is “positive and propositional” as Monbiot suggests, and bridges various carbon-rebalancing activities into one multi-layered societal activity. It is crafted to be compelling, inviting and quick to adopt, through visual narratives, open-sourcing, and community-led implementation, inspired by post-capitalist movements such as <i>Incredible Edible</i>, <i>Transition Network</i> and <i>Extinction Rebellion</i>. Vertical Commons is what anthropologist Lucy Suchman would describe as a “cultural imaginary” – a collective vision for the future, that is made manifest through developments in science, technology and culture.
