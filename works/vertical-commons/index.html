       Vertical Commons (working title) is a project of inter-related works, consisting of biotechnology, software and 3D files, and active, more-than-human assemblages. Furthermore, renders and game-engine simulations will be used to concurrently construct and visualise the full ontological imaginary of what this biotechnical paradigm could be.

        “Despair is the state we fall into when our imagination fails. When we have no stories that describe the present and the guide the future, hope evaporates. Without a new story, a story that is positive and propositional rather than reactive and oppositional, nothing changes. With such a story, everything changes.”

    <h5>Salix Viminalis (osier willow) are being grown from cuttings to eventually produce a supply of willow rods for vertical-commons. Communities will be able to share this resource by taking cuttings of their plants to pass on to others. </h5><br><br>

    <br><br>
<p>The willow-based structures act as carbon sinks since willow is a fast-growing native tree that produces 6ft rods per year, rapidly transforming CO2 into biomass. In the UK, willow is the second most beneficial tree to other species, second to oak, providing food and habitat for moths and birds such as the willow tit. The assembly of the willow rods is based on the formation of carbon nanotubes –arrangements of carbon atoms with incredible physical properties. These structures become vertical pillars upon which to support edible plant-life, aided by mycelium networks that interconnect the plants, transfering nutrients and chemical signals between them. 

  <br><br>
  The towers also perform a symbolic role – as monoliths that represent the existential threat of carbon imbalances. The designs of these willow structures will be distributed as software and 3D-print files contributed to the digital-commons. The project will manifest as both visual propositions and as living experiments involving more-than-human communities.
